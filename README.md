# Feature Engineering

## 1. Business Problem

Once the features are specified, a machine learning model has been developed to predict whether individuals have diabetes. Prior to developing the model, the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps have been detailed.

## 2. About Dataset

The dataset is part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the USA. The data was used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and older living in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in Arizona, USA. The target variable is specified as ‘outcome’; 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result, while 0 indicates a negative result.

* **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies
* **Glucose:** 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
* **Blood Pressure:** Blood Pressure (Diastolic) (mm Hg)
* **SkinThickness:** Skin Thickness
* **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes Pedigree Function
* **BMI:** Body Mass Index
* **Age:** Age (years)
